## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. I improved my skills in using semantic HTML5 markup. One of the challenges was handling hover states for interactive elements, which I solved using CSS pseudo-classes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on improving my JavaScript skills and integrating more interactivity into my web applications. I also want to explore CSS animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN provides comprehensive documentation and guides for web development. It was especially helpful in understanding CSS properties and JavaScript concepts.
